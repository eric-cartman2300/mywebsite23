    subtitle: "I am a master's in analytics and management student at London Business School.
      \n    I have worked as a data science and data analyst intern. \n    Currently I am 
      working on an impact consulting project with Bain & Company. \n   I love working out and
      also keep a keen interest in philosophy. \n   Reading phiosophical books helps me handle
      stress and deal with difficult situations. \n   I love exploring foods from different cuisines
      and culture. \n   I have made a lot of connections and friends over food and culture!"
